# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a real-world, full-stack development simulation designed to help developers build a scalable, secure, and collaborative web application inspired by Airbnb. This project emphasizes practical backend development skills using Django, GraphQL, and MySQL, combined with DevOps practices like CI/CD and Dockerization.

---

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the core server-side logic, RESTful or GraphQL APIs, and integration with databases. Ensures high performance and responsiveness.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the relational database schema, ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and handles backup/recovery strategies.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles the CI/CD pipeline setup, containerization (e.g., Docker), and deployment automation. Ensures stable and consistent deployment environments.

### Security Engineer
Implements API authentication and authorization, prevents attacks like SQL injection and XSS, and ensures secure data handling practices.

### Technical Writer / Project Manager
Documents all technical processes, coordinates team responsibilities, maintains timelines, and keeps project goals aligned with scope.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A Python web framework used to build the main application and REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **MySQL**: A relational database for structured data storage and queries.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible, efficient data querying and mutation between client and backend.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application, ensuring environment consistency.
- **GitHub Actions**: To set up automated testing, build, and deployment workflows.
- **Markdown**: For documentation and README creation.
- **NGINX/Gunicorn**: Web server stack for serving the application in production.

## Database Design

### Entities & Attributes

1. **User**
   - id (PK)
   - username
   - email
   - password
   - is_host

2. **Property**
   - id (PK)
   - host_id (FK to User)
   - title
   - description
   - location

3. **Booking**
   - id (PK)
   - user_id (FK to User)
   - property_id (FK to Property)
   - start_date
   - end_date

4. **Review**
   - id (PK)
   - booking_id (FK to Booking)
   - rating
   - comment

5. **Payment**
   - id (PK)
   - booking_id (FK to Booking)
   - amount
   - payment_status

### Relationships
- A **User** can be a guest or a host.
- A **Property** belongs to a host (User).
- A **Booking** is made by a guest for a specific Property.
- A **Review** is attached to a Booking.
- A **Payment** is tied to a Booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Users can register, log in, and choose to be guests or hosts. Includes password hashing, authentication, and profile management.

### Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, add descriptions, and manage availability. Photos and amenities can be uploaded and managed.

### Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and book them with dynamic date filtering and conflict checks.

### Review & Rating
After stays, users can review properties. Ratings influence search results and user trust.

### Payment Integration
Secure checkout flow with support for payment status, refund handling, and payment history.

---

## API Security

### Authentication
JWT or OAuth2 will be used to ensure only verified users can access protected endpoints.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only guests can book).

### Rate Limiting
To prevent brute-force attacks or spam requests on sensitive routes.

### Input Validation
Sanitization of all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.

### Secure Transactions
Sensitive data like passwords and payment information will be encrypted and securely transmitted.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the testing, building, and deployment of code changes, ensuring faster delivery and fewer errors.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment with YAML-based workflows.
- **Docker**: Provides isolated environments for dev, test, and production stages.
- **Heroku/Vercel/AWS**: Can be used for final deployment targets depending on preference.
